   supported

**Thanks for @jon007 and @decarvalhoaa for the amazing work in order to release this new version**

This release fixes a number of issues around handling of attributes and translations.
In particular:

1. New translations can now use auto-copy of source language, to help save time translating.
   In future a machine translation will be added.
	 Copy option covers Product Title, Short Description and Long Description.
   Also when creating a new product, any missing Product Categories, Tags and Attributes are copied,
   to avoid unexpected problems which occur if a translation is saved with missing term translations.

2. it is now possible to set up the system to allow different types of product attributes
to be synchronised, translated, or independent in each language. The default options will be:
 - Translation and Synchronization Enabled for Product Attributes
 - Synchronization off for Custom Product Attributes

In this case choose how to set up your product attributes as follows:
 - Translated Attribute?  Add in Products\Attributes and turn on Translation in Polylang at:
        Languages\Settings\Custom Taxonomies 
 - Synchronised Attribute? [eg same value in all languages, eg product code, numeric properties] 
				Add in Products\Attributes and leave Translation turned off in Polyang.
 - Different value in each language? add directly to Product as a Custom Product Attribute


* Enh: synchronisation for Custom Product Attributes and Global Product Attributes can now be 
       turned on and off independently in 
			 Settings\WooPoly, Metas List, Attributes Metas, Custom Product Attributes.
       The fields locker is unlocked for the attribute types which are not synchronized.
* Fix: Global Product Attributes can now be individually configured in Polylang:  
			 When Settings\WooPoly Translation attributes is checked then attributes appear in Polylang:
       Languages\Settings\Custom Taxonomies lists the individual taxonomies 
			 Previously all attributes translation were forced on: now they can be selectively turned
       on and off.  This means that there is no longer any need to create dummy translations for 
       untranslateable values such as reference codes and numeric fields.  Fixes #127.
CHANGE: new Product Attributes are no longer automatically enabled for translation,
       After creating new Attribute, enable Translation in Polylang if needed by checking:
			 Languages\Settings\Custom Taxonomies 
* Enh: Missing Term Translations are now added by default. Fixes #72
			 Applies to Products\Categories, Products\Tags, Products\Attributes 
       Previously missing term translations caused
